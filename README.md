##About Me
Kristin L Garbarino (She/Her)

As the Associate Marketing Director for Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, Kristin Garbarino oversees the school’s marketing and advertising. One of her most proud moments was the launch of Tepper’s 2021 brand repositioning: The Intelligent Future. Kristin was nominated by Tepper School Dean Isabelle Bajeux to participate in the 2022 Carnegie Mellon Executive Leadership Academy, which is designed for high-performing leaders within the university.

She is currently a Masters of Public Management candidate at Carnegie Mellon, where she is focusing her course work on data analytics and business intelligence. 

Prior to her work at CMU, Kristin marketed the arts for over a decade. As the Director of Digital Marketing & Engagement for the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, she oversaw eight websites, social media channels, email marketing, and was the marketing director for the Pittsburgh Dance Council. She launched the initiative to produce creative content within the company. Most proudly, she was the Executive Producer for the Trust’s first creative film initiative, It’s a Wonderful District (trustarts.org/wonderful), an homage to It’s a Wonderful Life that looks at what the Cultural District would be like if the Trust never came into existence. 

Outside of marketing, Kristin enjoys dancing. She was the co-founder and director of Pittsburgh aerial dance company bombyx collective (2014-2020). Other dance highlights include Sakshi Productions’ Prana/Breath at the Alvin Ailey Dance Theater in New York and CorningWorks’ production of The Tipping Point, an immersive collaboration with Doctors Without Borders that took audiences through the experience of a Syrian refugee family.

As a board member of Hello Neighbor, Kristin is committed to improving the experience of refugees in Pittsburgh. She and her husband, Richard, were a mentor family in Hello Neighbor’s first cohort. As the Vice President of the CorningWorks Board and a member of the Quantum Theater Marketing Committee, she advises two of the most innovative, thought-provoking arts companies in Pittsburgh.
