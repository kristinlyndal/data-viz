# Outline 

**High-level summary:** 
My final project focuses on Refugee Resettlement to the United States. Many know the stories of war-torn tragedy that results in refugee crises; the Ukrainian Refugee Crisis is only the latest to make headlines. Fear of letting in terrorist and losing out on jobs may make people disapprove of Refugee Resettlement. What people often don’t know is that it is incredibly safe to welcome refugees and they benefit the economy. 

**Project structure:** 
* Opening: Imagine fleeing your home. 
* Set-up: We all know the altruistic reasons to resettle refugees to the US. But you might not know how bringing refugees to our community helps you. 
*“Ah Ha” Moment #1: 
    * Myth: Bringing in refugees will just let in terrorists. 
    * Fact: A robust vetting process makes resettling refugees safe.
* “Ah Ha” Moment #2: 
* Myth: Bringing in refugees just costs us money and is a drain on our economy.
* Fact: Refugees pay more in taxes than they take and they help grow our economy.
* The Reality: Despite raising the refugee admission ceiling, we are not bringing in many refugees. 
* Call-to-Action: You can support refugees in Pittsburgh through Hello Neighbor. Follow them on Instagram at @helloneighborhq to learn how you can volunteer. 

# Initial Sketches

**Fact: A robust vetting process makes resettling refugees safe.**

To demonstrated thiis long vetting process, I will show a timeline. The major impact comes at the end with the years 2024 and 2025; this feels like a  long time from now, which illustrates how long the vetting process takes.

**Fact: Refugees pay more in taxes than they take and they help grow our economy.**

This barchart sets up a compairson between the general U.S. Population and Refugees per capital.

**The Reality: Despite raising the refugee admission ceiling, we are not bringing in many refugees.**

This chart grounds the problem in today.

# The Data

**Refugee Vetting Process** 

To visualize the refugee vetting process, I’ll use information from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services that explains the process. This information is written out, and I plan to present it more visually and in an estimated timeline. While this won’t use numeric data, it will use qualitative information in an “idea illustration.”

Information Source: [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, “Refugee Processing and Security Screening”](https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-and-asylum/refugees/refugee-processing-and-security-screening)

Information Source: [The New York Times, “Refugees Entering the U.S. Already
Face a Rigorous Vetting Process”](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/29/us/refugee-vetting-process.html)

**Refugees Pay Taxes and Grow the Economy** 

For this section, I will use data that was leaked from the Department of Health and Human Services by The New York Times. The data presents the fiscal expenditures for and revenues from refugees from 2005 to 2014. The data shows net positive revenue from refugees in the form of a simple excel-style chart. I’ll plan to use a more visually compelling design. 

Data Source: [Department of Health and Human Services, “The Fiscal Costs of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program at the Federal, State, and Local  Levels, from 2005 - ­2014” Report, as published by The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/19/us/politics/document-Refugee-Report.html) 

* Total Expenditures Over 10 Years (page 26) and Table 8. Expenditures for Refugees, by  Program, (pages 27-28) show how much is spent to support refugees.
* Table 9. Revenues from Refugees, by Source (page 30) details how much refugees pay the government in taxes.
* Table 11. Annual Per Capita Fiscal Impact for Refugees and General U.S. Population, by Years (page 37) shows that Refugees pay more in taxes than the U.S population per capita. 

**Refugee Admission Numbers** 

To show the numbers of admitted refugees compared with the admission ceiling, I will use data from the Refugee Processing Center. This will demonstrate the need for more support to resettle refugees as there is a large gap between the ceiling and actual number of admitted refugees (nearly 105k in FY 2022). 

Data Source: [The Refugee Processing Center (RPC), operated by the U.S Department of State, “Refugee Admissions Report as of August 31, 2022.”](

# Method and Medium
I will use Shorthand for the main medium. To determine the flow of the page, I will explore how the outline will translate into visuals and information. 

Quantitative charts will be created in Tableau, and qualitative information presented through Canva designs. These will first be thought through with sketches. 

Photography will be an important element as well. Images in the public domain or with a creative commons license will be used.
