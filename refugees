# A Dive Into Data on Refugees in the United States

Refugee support in my country is a topic that is incredibly important to me. I believe we have an obligation to welcome refugees to the United States in an organized manner. 

In 2017, my husband and I were a mentor family to a refugee family from Rwanda through Pittsburgh's [Hello Neighbor](https://helloneighbor.io). After that we became founding members of the mentor advisory board. I continued to deepen my work for Hello Neighbor this year and joined the board of directors.
