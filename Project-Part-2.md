# User Research

**Target Audience**

Those who may be potential volunteers for Hello Neighbor. They share a common value for respecting humanity. They read the news but do not yet know much about the details of the refugee process. They are open to new information. 

**Approach to Identifying Users**

I selected three people who I know are interested in volunteerism or human rights but have not expressed knowledge of refugee resettlement. They do not yet volunteer for Hello Neighbor but may have other volunteering experience. 

# Interview Script

| GOAL      | QUESTIONS |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| To understand what my  “Ah Ha” moment is      | What sticks in your mind?       |
|To understand the emotional impact   | How do you feel after seeing this presentation?        |
| To understand the strengths   | What resonated with you about the presentation? What worked well?        |
| To understand what was clear and what wasn’t | What was clear and easy to understand? What was unclear?  |
| To understand where the gaps of information are | What questions did you have during or after the presentation? <br /> Was there anything that you were unsure of that needed more explanation? |
| To understand what should be improved upon with my visuals and charts | Were there any visuals where your eyes were darting around a lot? <br />Do the visualizations support the presentation?<br />How can I improve the visuals? |
| To catch any final thoughts that my questions might have missed | What surprised you? <br />Is there anything I didn’t ask you about that you want to discuss? |

## User Interview #1

My first interview was with a 40s male, who identifies as a liberal. He volunteers for an education organization. His news sources are NPR and Axios. 

| GOAL   | FEEDBACK |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| To understand what my  “Ah Ha” moment is      | How few refugees we’ve resettled.    |
| To understand the emotional impact   | There's a lot of information in the process, but I guess it takes a long time for refugees to get resettled. It's an ongoing problem, and not a short term one.        |
| To understand the strengths     | I think what resonates is, how long it takes for a refugee to get resettled.<br /> <br /> The myths and the facts were backed up really well. |
| To understand what was clear and what wasn’t   | Clear: the process that the refugees have to take to be resettled.<br /><br />Unclear: the only thing that was unclear was the second table with the refugees, because it looked like all the black refugee spots were resettled except for the two.  |
| To understand where the gaps of information are     | Why were there so many unfilled spots? How can the UN give refugee status, but not give clearance to resettle them. <br /><br />The last graph, the scale of that on your computer was small relative to the data. And there was a lot of text on it; I couldn’t read it all. |
| To understand what should be improved upon with my visuals and charts  | I know it's just a draft, but the one about taxes. By the time you got to the bottom I had to remember which one was the refugees. As long as that's all fitting on one screen, then that's fine. |
| To catch any final thoughts that my questions might have missed     | How many refugees spots that were available. The rest of the world has to deal with all the rest of the the refugees.<br /><br />It’s the sheer numbers that were surprising. |

## User Interview #2

My second interview was with a 30s female, who identifies as a liberal. She volunteers for an arts organization. Her news sources are NPR and The New York Times.

| GOAL   | FEEDBACK |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| To understand what my  “Ah Ha” moment is      | The amount of time it takes to resettle a refugee.      |
| To understand the emotional impact   | The problem is more nuanced than what is discussed in the media.       |
| To understand the strengths     | I liked the visual representation of the number of refugees. I thought that was really effective. <br /><br />It was easy to correlate the number with how many people are actually behind that. And then, when you put the colored green section for the amount that we're actually being resettled in the United States. It just showed very easily and simply the small number of refugees that we're accepting in the United States versus the amount that are ready to be resettled.   |
| To understand what was clear and what wasn’t   | Clear: the process that the refugees have to take to be resettled.<br /><br />Unclear: I thought that the first point was hard to follow a little bit. The text with the myth was clear. But when we got to the diagram I felt that it was hard to really look at that diagram, assess exactly what was going on with the revenue versus the taxes.<br /><br />I feel like I needed maybe a little bit more time to take that in. Or maybe I needed it to be explained in a little bit of a different way.|
| To understand where the gaps of information are     | My questions were all in the first section. I didn't have the clear sense of where that data was like coming from in terms of like the revenue versus. Oh, I see your source now.<br /><br />he second section was so much clearer that that even thinking about the presentation of the whole, it it made like the first point, stick out, is not being as comprehensive. |
| To understand what should be improved upon with my visuals and charts  | My eyes darted around in the first one with the taxes and the revenues.         |
| To catch any final thoughts that my questions might have missed     | You didn't ask me about if it was clear to read the text, and if the colors were okay. I didn't have any problem with any of that.       |

## User Interview #3

My third interview was with a 70s female who identifies as an independent voter. She volunteers for her church, a counseling center, an education organization, and she runs a free head and neck cancer support group. Her news sources are the local newspaper and articles on Apple News.

| GOAL   | FEEDBACK |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| To understand what my  “Ah Ha” moment is      | How sad it is for refugees to legally be able to come into this country, and I would like to see them be able to legally enter. <br /><br />It also is a long process. I didn't realize it was so long.      |
| To understand the emotional impact   | I would like to see politicians focus on legislation to help them smooth the transition.        |
| To understand the strengths     | How long it takes to become a legal immigrant struck me. The numbers that are not being met now, the levels that they have to go through to get there. I agree that we need to have guidelines, but it seems to be severe.      |
| To understand what was clear and what wasn’t   | Clear: the process of becoming an immigrant<br /><br />Unclear: Sometimes the numbers of those little people were difficult to take in. Did that represent the number of people? I didn’t have time to count them.         |
| To understand where the gaps of information are     | Was there a discrepancy in the timeline? It takes some three years to get in?<br /><br />It was a lot of information. I would benefit by listening to it again.       |
| To understand what should be improved upon with my visuals and charts  | No, I think the visuals were focused. <br /><br />I see visuals are imperative.       |
| To catch any final thoughts that my questions might have missed     | I was surprised by the numbers that we have not achieved that this year.       |
