# User Research

**Target Audience**

Those who may be potential volunteers for Hello Neighbor. They share a common value for respecting humanity. They read the news but do not yet know much about the details of the refugee process. They are open to new information. 

**Approach to Identifying Users**

I selected three people who I know are interested in volunteerism or human rights but have not expressed knowledge of refugee resettlement. They do not yet volunteer for Hello Neighbor but may have other volunteering experience.

## User Interview #1

My first interview was with a 40s male, who identifies as a liberal. He volunteers for an education organization. His news sources are NPR and Axios. 

| GOAL   | FEEDBACK |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| To understand what my  “Ah Ha” moment is      | How few refugees we’ve resettled.    |
| To understand the emotional impact   | There's a lot of information in the process, but I guess it takes a long time for refugees to get resettled. It's an ongoing problem, and not a short term one.        |
| To understand the strengths     | I think what resonates is, how long it takes for a refugee to get resettled.<br /> <br /> The myths and the facts were backed up really well. |
| To understand what was clear and what wasn’t   | Clear: the process that the refugees have to take to be resettled.<br /><br />Unclear: the only thing that was unclear was the second table with the refugees, because it looked like all the black refugee spots were resettled except for the two.  |
| To understand where the gaps of information are     | Why were there so many unfilled spots? How can the UN give refugee status, but not give clearance to resettle them. <br /><br />The last graph, the scale of that on your computer was small relative to the data. And there was a lot of text on it; I couldn’t read it all. |
| To understand what should be improved upon with my visuals and charts  | I know it's just a draft, but the one about taxes. By the time you got to the bottom I had to remember which one was the refugees. As long as that's all fitting on one screen, then that's fine. |
| To catch any final thoughts that my questions might have missed     | How many refugees spots that were available. The rest of the world has to deal with all the rest of the the refugees.<br /><br />It’s the sheer numbers that were surprising. |

## User Interview #2

My second interview was with a 30s female, who identifies as a liberal. She volunteers for an arts organization. Her news sources are NPR and The New York Times.

| GOAL   | FEEDBACK |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| To understand what my  “Ah Ha” moment is      | The amount of time it takes to resettle a refugee.      |
| To understand the emotional impact   | The problem is more nuanced than what is discussed in the media.       |
| To understand the strengths     | I liked the visual representation of the number of refugees. I thought that was really effective. <br /><br />It was easy to correlate the number with how many people are actually behind that. And then, when you put the colored green section for the amount that we're actually being resettled in the United States. It just showed very easily and simply the small number of refugees that we're accepting in the United States versus the amount that are ready to be resettled.   |
| To understand what was clear and what wasn’t   | Clear: the process that the refugees have to take to be resettled.<br /><br />Unclear: I thought that the first point was hard to follow a little bit. The text with the myth was clear. But when we got to the diagram I felt that it was hard to really look at that diagram, assess exactly what was going on with the revenue versus the taxes.<br /><br />I feel like I needed maybe a little bit more time to take that in. Or maybe I needed it to be explained in a little bit of a different way.|
| To understand where the gaps of information are     | My questions were all in the first section. I didn't have the clear sense of where that data was like coming from in terms of like the revenue versus. Oh, I see your source now.<br /><br />he second section was so much clearer that that even thinking about the presentation of the whole, it it made like the first point, stick out, is not being as comprehensive. |
| To understand what should be improved upon with my visuals and charts  | My eyes darted around in the first one with the taxes and the revenues.         |
| To catch any final thoughts that my questions might have missed     | You didn't ask me about if it was clear to read the text, and if the colors were okay. I didn't have any problem with any of that.       |

## User Interview #3

My third interview was with a 70s female who identifies as an independent voter. She volunteers for her church, a counseling center, an education organization, and she runs a free head and neck cancer support group. Her news sources are the local newspaper and articles on Apple News.

| GOAL   | FEEDBACK |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| To understand what my  “Ah Ha” moment is      | How sad it is for refugees to legally be able to come into this country, and I would like to see them be able to legally enter. <br /><br />It also is a long process. I didn't realize it was so long.      |
| To understand the emotional impact   | I would like to see politicians focus on legislation to help them smooth the transition.        |
| To understand the strengths     | How long it takes to become a legal immigrant struck me. The numbers that are not being met now, the levels that they have to go through to get there. I agree that we need to have guidelines, but it seems to be severe.      |
| To understand what was clear and what wasn’t   | Clear: the process of becoming an immigrant<br /><br />Unclear: Sometimes the numbers of those little people were difficult to take in. Did that represent the number of people? I didn’t have time to count them.         |
| To understand where the gaps of information are     | Was there a discrepancy in the timeline? It takes some three years to get in?<br /><br />It was a lot of information. I would benefit by listening to it again.       |
| To understand what should be improved upon with my visuals and charts  | No, I think the visuals were focused. <br /><br />I see visuals are imperative.       |
| To catch any final thoughts that my questions might have missed     | I was surprised by the numbers that we have not achieved that this year.       |

## In-Class Group Interview

I also had a chance to review my wireframe and draft presentation with my in-class group. This included two international students, who are interested in public policy and are tech savvy women. 

| GOAL   | FEEDBACK |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| To understand what my  “Ah Ha” moment is | The thing that stuck with them most vividly were the two unit charts. It was especially exciting to show them these as it had been their suggestion last week! |
| To understand the emotional impact | Empathetic to the refugees. Hard to get through the whole process. It's a big problem. |
| To understand the strengths | The opening line is a strength and drew them in. |
| To understand what was clear and what wasn’t | Several charts that the title needs to be reworked and made more clear. |
| To understand where the gaps of information are | They said they would like to know more abut the story of what is like for refugees during the long resettlement process. They would like to know more about what can be done to help solve this problem as well. |
| To understand what should be improved upon with my visuals and charts | Chart titles can be make more clear and succint.<br />They commented on the large amount of white space in my Tableau graph and showed me how to make this adjustment. That was awesome! |


# Key Findings

* The two key points that stuck with users was unanimous: how long the process is to be resettled and how few refugees are being resettled in the U.S..
* Everyone thought the timeline was very strong and clear.
* The Myths/Facts setup was well received.

# Next Steps

Changes I plan on implementing based on user feedback:
* **Revise Unit Charts:** In the second unit chart, I will change the color of the people icons to grey. I may do this for the first unit chart too. 
* **Add context:** I will add copy about why there are many unfilled spots, more on the process, and what else can be done to improve the situation for those who would like to read more.
* **Revise Taxes Graph:** I will make the bottom of the graph line up and the top show the difference. Then I will adjust the title to better call out that this is what is spent and taxed per capita.
* **When presenting the Taxes Graph:** I will call out my source.
* **Revise the layout of the Timeline:** The timeline is overwhelmingly effective and the aspect that has the most impact. I plan to remove the added text on the left side and just focus on the timeline. I think there is enough information as is. 
* **Revise Unfilled Spots Graph:** I will adjust the text to focus more on the unfilled spots and less on the Biden administration since it is not the focus of my presentation. This title can be made more clear and succinct.
* **Revise Layout of Unfilled Spots Graph in Tableau:** I will adjust the layout to fill the width so as not to have a lot of extra white space under the chart. 

# Personas

I created two personas. One who is a retired woman focused on volunteering in her community, and one who is a younger man focused on staying up-to-date on news and his career. These represent two starkly different people who may both be interested in refugee resettlement and volunteering to help.

# Mood Words

In lieu of creating a mood board, I did want to take the time to think about the look and feel of my final project.

**Colors:** Black, Grey, White, Dark Blue, Green to highlight

The refugee crisis is bleak, and as one of the users said, it’s a long-term problem that won’t be solved soon. The color scheme should represent this through use of darker colors. However, the first priority is readability.

**Imagery:** Images of refugees from different parts of the world and dark textures.
