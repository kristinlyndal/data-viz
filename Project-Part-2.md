# User Research

**Target Audience**

Those who may be potential volunteers for Hello Neighbor. They share a common value for respecting humanity. They read the news but do not yet know much about the details of the refugee process. They are open to new information. 

**Approach to Identifying Users**

I selected three people who I know are interested in volunteerism or human rights but have not expressed knowledge of refugee resettlement. They do not yet volunteer for Hello Neighbor but may have other volunteering experience.
