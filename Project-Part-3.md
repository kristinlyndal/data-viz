<h2>The Inspiration for the Topic</h2>

[“Imagine Fleeing Your Home: How Resettling Refugees Can Benefit You”](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/imagine-fleeing-your-home/) in many ways started in 2017 when I started volunteering for Hello Neighbor as a mentor family. My husband and I were paired with a family from Rwanda. This life changing experience both educated me on what was happening on a large scale and personalized it in an individual way. 

It was during my mentor orientation that I learned about how extensive the vetting process is. I had no idea prior, so I knew this would be valuable information for policy students and potential advocates. 

I also know that refugee families tend to be hardworking, productive members of a community. As they had the resources to be able to flee in the first place, they were often professionals and business owners in their home country. I wanted to show how it benefits our economy to accept refugees. 

I’ve been reading about how dire the numbers are and how much the pandemic has made things worse. This was a valuable way for me to analyze how everything is working and assess the situation. 

<h2>Building Out the Idea</h2>

Next I needed to think about how to show these concepts visually. For the economic benefit, the data I found drove the chart. The data was presented in a simple excel-style chart. It compared the average refugee with the average U.S. citizen and their tax revenue and expenditure. This led me to do a stacked bar chart.

For the vetting process, I started listing out the steps. Then I decided to put it into a timeline to emphasize how long and arduous the process is. I wanted to hit hard what it means for the process to take three years. When you hear three years, it might not sound like a long time. When you see October 2025, that feels like ages from now. 

For the unfilled refugee spots, this was informed by an earlier class project. 

I also thought about the content that should support the structure of the site and the visuals. Throughout the process, I’ve been reading articles and taking notes, allowing me to slowly hone the content.

<h2>User Testing</h2>

User Testing has been a critical part of this project. I’ve been able to learn about how the visuals and content lands and where the gaps are. This has allowed me to tweak the site and hone in on the most powerful items. 

Key takeaways from my testing included:
* The two key points that stuck with users was unanimous: how long the process is to be resettled and how few refugees are being resettled in the U.S. This helped me focus my one-minute presentation on what would be most impactful. 
* Simplify chart titles: users struggled to read all of the text on my charts as I was presenting to them. This convinced me that I needed to simplify my chart text and add additional context to the paragraphs above or under the charts.

<h2>The Audience and CTA</h2>

I have two primary goals for this presentation and site:

1. Dispel myths about refugee resettlement
2. Grow the volunteer based for Hello Neighbor

The prime audience is someone in Pittsburgh who is open to learning about refugee resettlement. 

My two goals align when the user is in Pittsburgh, though it could be beneficial for audiences outside of Pittsburgh as only one Call-to-Action section is focused on the Pittsburgh area. Additionally audiences outside of Pittsburgh could learn how to support refugee resettlement organizations in their community. 

A key aspect of my target user is that they must be open to learning about refugees. In this way, a liberal-leaning, educated user would benefit by learning more about a process they potentially already support. The site/presentation could have the most benefit by helping to influence a user who is on the fence about refugee resettlement because they don’t know that resettlement is a safe process and beneficial to the U.S. economy. 

This latter user became especially apparent during user testing with an Obama/Trump voter, who identifies as an independent. They were very receptive to the information. In this way, the myth/fact setup could be especially effective.
