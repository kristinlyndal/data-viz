# Author's Notee

This data was pulled from OEDC's section on general government debt. The first and third visualizations focus soley on 2019, and the second visualization shows a range by country from 1995 to 2019 depending on information available by year and country. 

Looking at all countries in 2019, I asked myself, how much debt is healthy? Wealthier countries tend to have a higher debt-to-GDP ratio than poorer countries. Some wealther countries, like Switzerland and Germany, buck this trend and have a significantly lower ratio. On the opposite end is Japan, whose debt far out weighs their wealthy peers. This led me to compairing thhe G7 countries, a set of the most powerful, first-world countries. 

I tried a few different chart types before landing on the Hierarchy Treemap. With this visualization, we can see that Japan's debt is nearly as large as the United States and Canada combined. When compaired with their European counterparts, Japan's debt seems astromonical as we see that is the debt of more than two major European countries combined.
