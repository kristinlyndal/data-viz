# Author's Note

This data was pulled from OEDC's section on general government debt. These visualizations focus on the country, year, and debt-to-GDP ratio.  The first and third visualizations focus soley on 2019. The second visualization shows a range by country from 1995 to 2019 depending on information available by year and country, and the fourth from 1995 to 2021. 

Looking at all countries in 2019, I asked myself, how much debt is healthy? Wealthier countries tend to have a higher debt-to-GDP ratio than poorer countries. Some wealther countries, like Switzerland and Germany, buck this trend and have a significantly lower ratio. On the opposite end is Japan, whose debt-to-GDP far out weighs their wealthy peers. This led me to compairing the G7 countries, a set of the most powerful, first-world countries. 

I tried a few different chart types before landing on the Hierarchy Treemap. With this visualization, we can see that Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio is nearly as large as the United States and Canada combined. When compaired with their European counterparts, Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio seems astromonical as we see that it is more than two of the major European countries combined. 

This exercise showed me that when there is a lot of data, a bar chart or table works best (at least given my design/creation skills thus far). In order to use a different visualization structure, I needed to focus on a small subset of the data. Once when I was trying to use a larger amount of data, I wound up creating a bar chart without even realizing it until I stepped back for a moment.
